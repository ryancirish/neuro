- first commit includes (got ahead of myself!!)

Create a web REST application with a '/mood' endpoint, which when POSTed to persists the
submitted mood value.
Add the ability for users to login.
Update the '/mood' endpoint with a GET method, so it only returns values submitted by the
logged-in user.

- second commit is .gitignore

- third commit: Add to the body of the response for the ‘/mood’ endpoint the length of their current "streak".

- fourth commit: fix the [Update the '/mood' endpoint with a GET method...] step, results were not serialized into json
