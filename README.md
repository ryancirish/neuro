# Assessment for Neuroflow

- first commit includes (got ahead of myself!!)
Create a web REST application with a '/mood' endpoint, which when POSTed to persists the
submitted mood value.
Add the ability for users to login.
Update the '/mood' endpoint with a GET method, so it only returns values submitted by the
logged-in user.
